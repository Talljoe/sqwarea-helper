h1. Features

h2. New functionality
* See coordinates of squares and go directly to any coordinate. (In tooltip or via Ctrl-Click of square.)
* See travel time for squares so you know when your attack will land (and to avoid sending attacks out of order).
* Easily bank troops on the king square.
* Default to 10 troops for reinforcement to keep from accidentally sending half your troops to a square.
* Override the default troop counts for attacks and reinforcements.

h2. Bug fixes
* Only lists latest 200 entries in events tab to address performance issues.
* Fixes blank textboxes when using keyboard shortcuts.
* Sending to a neutral sqaure defaults to 11 troops instead of 1.
* Fixes disappearing dialog boxes on escape.
